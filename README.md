iPhone app that records a conversation with you and a friend and plays it back to make you sound like a chipmunk or Darth Vader!
This app is the first app created on my iOS Nanogedree at Udacity.

With this App I Learned:

Introduction to Swift and Xcode, taking the first steps in becoming an iOS developer.

What is Storyboard, AutoLayout, UIButtons and UILabels. 

View Controllers, View Controller Lifecycle, and Multiple Views. 

How to react to touch events and change the user interface based on those events.

Introduction to AVAudioRecorder, Delegation, and programatic segues.

Setup audio playback including rate, pitch, echo, and reverb.

About UIStackViews and class extensions.
